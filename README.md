Its a portfolio where I put my best artwork, and when someone asks to see my art I can send them the Link!
Made without AI (Which is why it looks so bad) in HTML CSS and javascript. the reason github doesnt say I used CSS is because I coded all my html and css in the same file. its a little chaotic.
